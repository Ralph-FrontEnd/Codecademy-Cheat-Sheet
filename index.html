                Well lets start with a little about me! I am known online via the alias "Ralph" of which I adopted 3 years ago through gaming, just as a way of keeping personal separate from public.
                <br>
                I left school at the age of 17 to focus on work and fell feet first into the world of logistics and warehousing. Of which I've been doing now for the last 11 years, and now at the age of 28 I've felt the urge for a career change!
                <br>     
                <br>
                Which is where we are now, here on this website made by me! My long term goal is to move into a career within Web Development.
                <br>
                I am currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript on the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> website. As of yet I haven't touched the JavaScript side of web development but will be doing so eventually.
                <br>
                This Cheat Sheet is an off platform project that you are requested to do during the lessons, basically covering anything you want from what you've learned so far. And this here, is my attempt at making my own cheat sheet! 
                <br>     
                <br>
                So feel free to have a poke around, the footer at the bottom has contact information and the source code link on Github! Constructive feedback is always appreciated.
            </p>

            <p class="mainContent issues">
                Where I am new to everything, lots of learning still to be done! Here I shall keep a list of bugs that I find or people tell me of in order to fix them once I learn how! 
                <ul class="issues">
                    <li>Resizing to a smaller window causes elements to start overlapping (mainly the header), which makes mobile viewing likely horrible.</li>
                    <li>Not so much an issue, but I've come to learn that when styling with CSS it's better practice to rely on inheritance more reducing the amount of CSS needed. </li>
